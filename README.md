# Hair Strand Detection System Using Image Segmentation  

## Introduction  
The **Hair Strand Detection System** is an advanced AI-based solution designed to analyze and detect individual hair strands from high-resolution trichoscope images. By leveraging cutting-edge deep learning techniques, this project aims to automate and enhance the precision of hair analysis for applications in dermatology, cosmetic research, and personalized hair care.  

## Features  
- Utilizes the YOLOv11l-seg.pt model optimized for segmentation.  
- Implements image segmentation to distinguish hair strands from the background.  
- High accuracy in detecting precise boundaries of hair strands.  
- Scalable and efficient for real-time applications.  

## Technologies Used  
- **YOLOv11l-seg.pt**: A YOLO-based model for optimized segmentation.  
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch.  
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV.  
- **Programming Language**: Python.  
- **Hardware Acceleration**: GPU for model training and inference.
